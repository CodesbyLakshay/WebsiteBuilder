## Overview

WebsiteBuilder is a powerful backend solution designed to simplify the creation, management, and security of web applications. It provides a complete toolkit for developers, featuring robust authentication, granular role-based permissions, AI-powered content generation, and dynamic website previews.

### Why WebsiteBuilder?

This project helps developers streamline app security, configuration, and website content management. The core features include:

üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Authentication**: Implements JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions and API access.
üö¶ **Role-Based Access Control**: Utilizes middleware to enforce permissions for `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Viewer` roles, safeguarding sensitive endpoints.
ü§ñ **AI Content Generation**: Features an endpoint ready to integrate with AI models (like OpenAI or Hugging Face) to generate website content based on user prompts.
üåê **Dynamic Website Preview**: Dynamically renders website content using Flask and Jinja2, providing a live preview before deployment.
üìÅ **Full CRUD Operations**: Manages website and user data efficiently with built-in MongoDB interactions.
‚öôÔ∏è **Centralized Configuration**: Simplifies environment-specific settings for seamless deployment using a `.env` file.
üöÄ **Easy App Initialization**: Provides a streamlined startup script (`run.py`) for local development and testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following to be installed on your system:
* **Python 3.8+**
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* **MongoDB** running locally or a connection URI.

### Installation

Build WebsiteBuilder from the source and install dependencies:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/CodesbyLakshay/WebsiteBuilder](https://github.com/CodesbyLakshay/WebsiteBuilder)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd WebsiteBuilder
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        python -m venv .venv
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
    * Add the following variables. You can generate a new `JWT_SECRET_KEY` using the `generate_jwt_key.py` script.
        ```env
        MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/website_builder"
        JWT_SECRET_KEY="your_super_secret_jwt_key_here"
        HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your_huggingface_api_key_optional"
        ```

## Usage

Run the project with the following commands after activating your virtual environment:

1.  **Activate the virtual environment** (if not already active):
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

2.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```
    The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes several API endpoints for authentication, website management, and admin controls. You can find a complete list of cURL commands to interact with these endpoints in Postman or a similar API client.

Key endpoints include:
* `/signup`, `/login`
* `/websites`, `/websites/<id>`
* `/preview/<id>`
* `/admin/users`, `/admin/users/<id>`, `/admin/roles`

## Testing

This project is set up for testing with `pytest`. To run the test suite, use the following command after activating your virtual environment:

```sh
pytest
